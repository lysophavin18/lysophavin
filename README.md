## 📄 About Me

> “Cybersecurity is not just a technology problem — it’s a thinking problem.”

I am currently conducting security research focused on **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**, **penetration testing**, and **automated threat analysis**. My academic background and hands-on lab work empower me to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world cyber defense applications.
